The night before Christmas, one of Santa's Elves calls you in a panic. "The printer's broken! We can't print the _Naughty or Nice List_!" By the time you make it to sub-basement 17, there are only a few minutes until midnight. "We have a big problem," she says; "there must be almost _fifty_ bugs in this system, but nothing else can print The List. Stand in this square, quick! There's no time to explain; if you can convince them to pay you in **stars**, you'll be able to--" She pulls a lever and the world goes blurry.

When your eyes can focus again, everything seems a lot more pixelated than before. She must have sent you inside the computer! You check the system clock: _25 milliseconds_ until midnight. With that much time, you should be able to collect all **fifty stars** by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each ~~day~~ millisecond in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants **one star**. Good luck!
